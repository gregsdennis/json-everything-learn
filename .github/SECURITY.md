## Personal Information

Please don't share any personal information you don't want _everyone_ to know.  Once it's on the internet, it's there forever.

Even editing personal information out of comments doesn't remove it, as comment history is available.

## Secure/Privileged Information

Please don't share any secure details, such as passwords or other keys.

Please don't share any proprietary information or code.  If posting examples, create a [minimal reproducible example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example).

If for some reason secure information must be shared, please arrange to DM me (gregsdennis) in Slack (link in the README).  I will not share any such information, and since the workspace is free, any messages will eventually be lost to the void.

## Security Reporting

Please share any security issues you find by DM'ing me in Slack.  My best effort will be made to resolve these issues.
