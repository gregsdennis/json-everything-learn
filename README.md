## Welcome

This repository houses the source for `json-everything` learning site, https://learn.json-everything.net.

## Contributing

We're happy to accept and review proposals for lessons.  In general, lessons will cover how to use the libraries.

Each lesson should focus on a single feature of the library.  The coding exercise should be tailored so that completion requires the learner to use the feature.

There is a lesson editor WPF app that makes creating lessons quite simple.  If you're just creating a lesson, running this app (`run edit`) is recommended.

The main project's [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/json-everything/json-everything/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) also applies.

## Running locally

The site is a Blazor WASM app running .Net 8, and it's published via GitHub Pages.

You can run the `run.cmd` script to start up the site.  If you add an `edit` parameter, it'll run the editor.
